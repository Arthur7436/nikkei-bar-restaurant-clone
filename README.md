# Nikkei bar restaurant clone
Hello friend! Thank you for having a look at one of my pet projects!

## About
Whenever I get the chance to eat out, I know that everytime I see a Japanese restaurant, I know I'm not going to be dissapointed. Especially if they have Japanese curry with katsu chicken with miso soup on a cold winter day.....(Daydream face). On a serious note, since I love asian cuisine, I thought to myself "Why not practice your HTML and CSS by cloning a restaurant that looks like it's fire?". And behold, the nikkei-bar-resaurant-clone repository was created. 

Please have a look at my project <a href="">here</a>.

Here is the original <a href="https://nikkeibar.com.au/">website</a>.

## Challenges I faced when building this project
1. <b>Navbar hover movement:</b> Everytime I hovered over the main navbar section, the entire navbar along with the section with the main background image tends to move down slightly. To solve this, I looked into the dev tools on Google chrome and found out that the <code>a</code> tags within each navbar title had a <code>display value</code> of <code>block</code> due to Bootstrap 5 having <code>.nav-link</code> <code>display</code> as <code>block</code>. By changing the <code>display</code> to <code>inline</code>, the movement dissappeared everytime I hovered.
