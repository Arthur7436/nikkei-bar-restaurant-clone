# nikkei-bar-restaurant-clone
Hello friend! Thank you for having a look at one of my pet projects!

## About
Whenever I get the chance to eat out, I know that everytime I see a Japanese restaurant, I know I'm not going to be dissapointed. Especially if they have Japanese curry with katsu chicken with miso soup on a cold winter day.....(Daydream face). On a serious note, since I love asian cuisine, I thought to myself "Why not practice your HTML and CSS by cloning a restaurant that looks like it's fire?". And behold, the nikkei-bar-resaurant-clone repository was created. 

Please have a look at my project <a href="">here</a>.

Here is the original <a href="https://nikkeibar.com.au/">website</a>.
